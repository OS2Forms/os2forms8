description: 'Installation profile for os2forms_forloeb'
core_version_requirement: '^8.9 || ^9'
langcode: da

# Optional: Declare your installation profile as a distribution
# This will make the installer auto-select this installation profile.
# The distribution_name property is used in the installer and other places as
# a label for the software being installed.
# distribution:
  # name: os2forms_forloeb_profile
  # If you want your distribution to pre-select a language you can specify
  # the language code, as well. This will prevent the user from selecting
  # a language code in the user interface. While not recommended for generic
  # community distributions, this can be very useful for distributions that
  # are tailored to a language-specific audience (for example government
  # institutions in a certain country) but also site-specific installation
  # profiles. Note that this language code will also be used when installing
  # the site via Drush.
  #
  # To set your theme as the theme for the distribution installation uncomment the following:
  #
  # install:
  #  theme: my_theme
