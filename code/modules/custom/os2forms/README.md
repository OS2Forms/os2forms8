# OS2Forms Drupal module  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OS2Forms/os2forms.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/OS2Forms/os2forms)

## Install

OS2Forms Drupal 8 module is available to download via composer.
```
composer require os2forms/os2forms
drush en os2forms
```

If you don't have Drupal installed on you server, you will to need install it first.
Read more about [how to install drupal core](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install).

We are recommending to install drupal via composer by using
[OS2Forms composer project](https://github.com/OS2Forms/composer-project).
By this way you will get standalone project with OS2Forms module on board, plus
all the other contrib modules you will probably need to configure OS2Forms to
your specific demands.
```
composer create-project os2forms/composer-project:8.x-dev some-dir --no-interaction
```

To get more benefits on your Drupal project we are offering you to use
[OS2web](https://packagist.org/packages/os2web/os2web) as installation
profile for Drupal. This profile is a part of OS2Forms composer project
mentioned above.

You can easy download and install OS2web installation profile to your
composer based Drupal project with commands:
```
composer require os2web/os2web
drush si os2web --db-url=mysql://db_user:db_pass@mysql_host/db_name --locale=da --site-name="OS2Forms" --account-pass=admin -y
```

## Update
Updating process for OS2forms module is similar to usual Drupal 8 module.

```
composer outdated os2forms/os2forms
```

## Important notes
### Webforms
Each webform, including all its settings, is stored as configuration in db and
will(could) be exported as `yml` file via Drupal configuration management
system. And afterwards could be tracked by `git`.

It means that all webform settings from drupal database will
be syncronized (exported/imported) with state stored in `yml` files from
configuration folder stored in git repository. Without proper actions webforms
could be deleted or reverted to state in `yml` during synchronization.

To avoid/prevent this behavior we recommend use `Config ignore` module, where
you can add all settings you do not want to export/import via configuration
management system.

### Serviceplatformen plugins
Settings for CPR and CVR serviceplantormen plugins are storing as configuration
in db and will(could) be exported as `yml` file via Drupal configuration
management system. And afterwards could be tracked by `git`.

If case you have public access to your git repository all setting from plugins
will be exposed for third persons.

To avoid/prevent this behavior we recommend use `Config ignore` module, where
you can add all settings you do not want to export/import via configuration
management system.

## Unstable features
### Export submissions to Word
This feature is still not part of Webform and Entity print modules stable versions
due to following issues:
* [[Webform] Unlock possibility of using Entity print module export to Word feature](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform/issues/3096552)
* [[Entity Print] Add Export to Word Support](https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_print/issues/2733781)

To get this functionality on drupal project there will be applied patches from issues above via Composer.

NOTE: If you are downloading os2forms module without using composer, be aware that you have apply those patches by yourself.
